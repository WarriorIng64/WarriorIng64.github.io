My personal website. It currently includes:

- Links to various things, including some of my online profiles
- A list of my personal projects
- Some basic information about me
- Instructions to potential employers about how to request a copy of my résumé
- A list of bugs I fixed in open-source projects

It can be accessed at [www.christopherkylehorton.com][1] in any modern HTML5 browser. Internet Explorer versions previous to 11 are not supported.

I also have a blog at [blog.christopherkylehorton.com][2], but that's actually hosted on Blogger (for now).
